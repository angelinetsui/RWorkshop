# 2019 R Tutorial
Natalia Vélez, July 2019

In this tutorial, we're going to look at the data from a paper we've read recently and attempt to reproduce the main results! These data come from:
Liu, S., Ullman, T. D., Tenenbaum, J. B., & Spelke, E. S. (2017). Ten-month-old infants infer the value of goals from the costs of actions. Science, 358(6366), 1038-1041.
